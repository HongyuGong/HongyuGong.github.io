I am currently a Ph.D. student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with Natural Language Processing as my research area. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. Pramod Viswanath and Prof. Suma Bhat. I got my Bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, where I was in IEEE pilot class and advised by Prof. Xinbing Wang.
