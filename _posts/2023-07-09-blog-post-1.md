With the popularity of language modeling, there have been many advances in speech language models. The complexity of modeling speech signls lies in the manipulation and computation of continous-valued waveforms or features. Recent works tackle it with pretrained speech tokenizers, and convert speech into discrete tokens (also called units), and here is a [blog](https://hongyugong.github.io/posts/2023/07/blog-post-1/) about popular speech tokenizers. Techniques used in text language modeling can be easily applied to unit language modeling for speech. Below we introduce some recent works on speech language modelings and their applications.
